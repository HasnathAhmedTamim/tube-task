          Discuss the scope of var, let, and const

          <h2 class="font-bold text-black">"var":</h2>
          <p class="font-bold text-black ">
            var is the oldest variable declaration keyword in JavaScript, and it
            has function scope.It becomes a global variable and is accessible
            throughout the entire JavaScript program.
          </p>
          <ul class="font-bold text-amber-500">
            <li>1.Function-scoped or globally-scoped.</li>
            <li>2.Hoisted to the top of the function or global scope</li>
            <li>3.Can lead to unexpected behavior due to hoisting.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-blue-200 p-4 mb-3">
          <h class="font-bold text-black ">"let":</h2>
          <p class="font-bold text-black">
            let was introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) to address some of the
            issues with var. Variables declared with let have block scope, which
            means they are limited to the block in which they are defined, such
            as within loops or conditional statements.
          </p>
          <ul class="font-bold text-amber-500 ">
            <li>1.Block-scoped, making it safer and more predictable..</li>
            <li>2.Not hoisted to the top of the block</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-blue-200 p-4 mb-3">
          <h2 class="font-bold text-black">"const":</h2>
          <p class="font-bold text-black">
            const is also introduced in ES6, and it has block scope like let.
            However, const is used to declare constants, and once a value is
            assigned to a const variable, it cannot be reassigned.
          </p>
          <ul class="font-bold text-amber-500">
            <li>1.Block-scoped, just like let.</li>
            <li>2.Must be initialized when declared</li>
            <li>
              3.Values assigned to const variables cannot be changed
              (immutable).

          <h2 class="font-bold text-black">Use Cases of null :</h2>
          <ul class="font-bold text-amber-500">
            <li>
              1.null represents the intentional absence of any object value.
            </li>
            <li>
              2.Use it when you want to explicitly state that a variable or
              object property has no meaningful value.
            </li>
            <li>
              3.It is often used to indicate that a variable should have no
              value or that a property should be empty.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2 class="font-bold text-black">Use Cases of undefined :</h2>
          <ul class="font-bold text-amber-500">
            <li>
              1.undefined is the default value of variables that have been
              declared but have not been assigned a value.
            </li>
            <li>
              2.Functions that do not explicitly return a value will return
              undefined.
            </li>
            <li>
              3.Use it when a variable is declared but not yet initialized or
              when you need to check if a property exists in an object.

          What do you mean by REST API?

            REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming
            Interface)
          </h2>

          <ul class="font-bold text-black">
            <li>
              HTTP-Based: REST typically uses HTTP as the communication
              protocol. This means it leverages the standard HTTP methods such
              as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE for various operations.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              Architectural Style: REST is not a protocol but an architectural
              style used for designing networked applications.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              Resource-Centric: In REST, everything is considered a resource,
              and these resources are identified by URLs (Uniform Resource
              Locators)
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              Stateless Communication: REST APIs rely on stateless communication
              between the client and server. Each request from the client to the
              server is independent and self-contained.
            </li>

            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              CRUD Operations: REST APIs are used for performing CRUD (Create,
              Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources. For example, you
              can create a new resource, retrieve its data, update it, or delete
              it.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              Security: Security mechanisms such as HTTPS and authentication can
              be applied to REST APIs to protect data during transmission and
              restrict access to authorized users.
            </li>
